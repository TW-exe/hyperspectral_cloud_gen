# Mission objective  
- Collect and archive medium-resolution (circa 30-meter (m) spatial resolution) multispectral image data affording seasonal coverage of the global land mass for a period of no less than five years, with no credible single-point failures. 
- Collect and archive moderate-resolution (circa 120 m ground-sample distance) thermal image data affording seasonal coverage of the global land mass for a continuous period of no less than five years, with no credible single-point failures. 
- Ensure that L9 data are sufficiently consistent with data from the earlier Landsat missions, in terms of acquisition geometry, calibration, coverage characteristics,  - 2 - LSDS-2082 Version 1.0 spectral characteristics, output product quality, and data availability to permit studies of land surface change over multidecadal periods. 
- Distribute L9 data products to the public on a nondiscriminatory basis.

# Purpose and Scope 
The primary purpose of this document is to provide a basic understanding and associated reference material for the L9 Observatory and its science data products.
